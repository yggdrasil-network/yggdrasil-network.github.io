ðŸš¨ **Please remember to check for Yggdrasil updates regularly.** ðŸš¨ Yggdrasil does not have a built-in method of notifying you when new versions are available. You may want to subscribe to the [GitHub Releases Atom feed](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/releases.atom) or consider [watching the GitHub repository](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go) (a "Custom" watch can be used to subscribe to release notifications only). Release notifications are also sent in our [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#yggdrasil:matrix.org).

ðŸ’¡ **For secure operation without exposing local ports**, consider using [Yggstack](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggstack). It provides SOCKS5 proxy server and TCP port forwarder functionalities, enabling network access without needing root/administrator privileges and TUN adapter support.
