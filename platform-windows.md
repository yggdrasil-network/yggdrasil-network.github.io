# Windows

Yggdrasil has been tested and is working on the following versions of Windows:

- Windows 7
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10
- Windows Server 2016

It may work on other versions of Windows too, although these are untested.

## Automated package (yggdrasil-waash)

There is now an automated package for Windows which contains both the TAP driver and yggdrasil itself.
It also allows for an easy configuration of peers to connect to and comes with a long list of public
peers. Download from https://github.com/carnhofdaki/yggdrasil-waash/releases

The original documentation for manual intallation continues:

## TAP Driver

Yggdrasil depends on the OpenVPN TAP driver to work on Windows. There are two flavours of this driver:

- [NDIS 5](https://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/tap-windows-9.9.2_3.exe) (`tap-windows-9.9.2_3`) - recommended
- [NDIS 6](https://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/tap-windows-9.21.2.exe) (`tap-windows-9.21.2`) - functional

Yggdrasil works with either driver, although the performance is remarkably better with the older NDIS 5 driver, therefore it is recommended to use that instead of the NDIS 6 driver.

Please note that if you already have OpenVPN for Windows, you likely have one of the two drivers installed already and should not install it again.

## Notes

- TUN mode is not supported on Windows, and attempts to configure TUN mode will default to TAP mode automatically.

## Installation

Start by [downloading the latest Yggdrasil binary](https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/latest/artifacts) and use Windows Explorer to copy it into a sensible location and rename it to `yggdrasil.exe`.

The below examples assume that you placed `yggdrasil.exe` into `C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil`.

## Generate configuration

Before starting Yggdrasil, you should generate configuration. Open a Command Prompt as Administrator:
```
"C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil\yggdrasil.exe" -genconf > "C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil\yggdrasil.conf"
```

## Run Yggdrasil

### Run once

Open a Command Prompt as Administrator and start Yggdrasil using your generated configuration:
```
"C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil\yggdrasil.exe" -useconffile "C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil\yggdrasil.conf"
```
Alternatively, start Yggdrasil in auto-configuration mode:
```
"C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil\yggdrasil.exe" -autoconf
```

### Run as a background service

Running as a background system service means that Yggdrasil will automatically start up in the background when Windows boots.

Assuming that Yggdrasil is installed into `C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil` and your configuration *already exists* in `C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil\yggdrasil.conf`, as above, then you can install Yggdrasil as a Windows service. Open a Command Prompt as Administrator:
```
sc create yggdrasil binpath= "\"C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil\yggdrasil.exe\" -useconffile \"C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil\yggdrasil.conf\""
sc config yggdrasil displayname= "Yggdrasil Service"
sc config yggdrasil start= "auto"
sc start yggdrasil
```
Alternatively, if you want the service to autoconfigure instead of using an `yggdrasil.conf`, replace the `sc create` line from above with:
```
sc create yggdrasil binpath= "\"C:\Program Files\Yggdrasil\yggdrasil.exe\" -autoconf"
```

The Yggdrasil service can then be stopped and started using `services.msc`, or in more recent versions of Windows, the Task Manager.
